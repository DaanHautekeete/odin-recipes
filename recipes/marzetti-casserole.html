        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kids love this buffet-ready Johnny Marzetti casserole. My mother-in-law used to make a simpler version of this for my husband when he was growing up. This version pushes the flavor profile a bit. Sometimes I let the casserole sit overnight before baking, as the flavors improve and the pasta absorbs some of the sauce, so the consistency is just right.</p>
    
        <p>The preparation time is 30 mins and the cooking time is 1hr and 5mins. You have an additional time of 15mins. After cooking for around 1hr and 50 mins, you have 6 servings ready. </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
         <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 7x11-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
         <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 6 to 8 minutes; drain. Run cold water over pasta to stop it from cooking further.</li>
         <li>While the pasta is cooking, cook ground beef and sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until completely browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Add onion, celery, garlic, and bell pepper; cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in tomato sauce and diced tomatoes. Let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
         <li>Spread pasta over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Italian cheese blend over rotini, then pour meat sauce over top. Cover the dish with heavy-duty aluminum foil.</li>
         <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the casserole. Continue to bake until Cheddar has melted, about 5 minutes. Rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
